### Overview

In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. To finish this task, I called the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

Because of the risk of publicly displaying gifs, I included a gitnore file after this assignment was graded.

### Assignment Instructions

* Create an array of strings, each one related to a topic of my choice (movies).
* This app took the topics in the array and created buttons in my HTML.
* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and placed them on the page.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
* A form wasadded to take a value from a user input box and adds it to the topics array. A function call was created to take each topic in the array and remake the buttons on the page.
